# STM32F4-Based-Real-Time-Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-NTC-Thermistor
Designed and implemented a temperature monitoring system using STM32F4 at register level. Interfaced NTC thermistor with ADC to measure temperature using Beta equation. Configured TIM7 interrupt for temperature-based LED blinking control. Implemented real-time embedded logic with direct peripheral register programming.
